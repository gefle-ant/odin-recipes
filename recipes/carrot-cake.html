    <h2>100 Carrot, Carrot Cake</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, a vegetable can be made into a cake, 
        a delicious cake that you will want to eat,
        unless you're weird or allergic to carrots.
    </p>
    <p>
        This simple but delicious recipe also comes
        to us via Bon Apetit, because I didn't feel
        like translating Betti Bossi's Swiss version, 
        which is better, less sweet and the version
        I would choose at this stage of my life.

    <h3>100 Carrot, Carrot Cake Preparation</h3>
    <h4>Cake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°. Lightly coat two 9"-diameter 
            cake pans with nonstick spray. Line bottoms with 
            parchment paper rounds; lightly coat rounds with 
            nonstick spray. If using raisins and rum, heat 
            together in a small saucepan over low just until 
            warm, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let 
            sit until liquid is absorbed and raisins are plump, 
            15-20 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, 
            tossing once, until golden brown, 8-10 minutes; 
            let cool. Combine carrots and buttermilk in a 
            medium bowl.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Whisk flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking 
            powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. 
            Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 
            eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla 
            extract until pale and thick, about 4 minutes. 
            Reduce speed to medium-low and gradually 
            stream in oil. Add dry ingredients in 3 
            additions, alternating with carrot mixture 
            in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry 
            ingredients; mix until smooth. Fold in raisins, 
            if using, and walnuts with a rubber spatula. 
            Scrape batter into prepared pans.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, 
            until a tester inserted into the center comes 
            out clean, 35-45 minutes. Transfer pans to a 
            wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes. Run 
            a knife around sides of cakes and invert onto 
            wire rack; remove parchment. Let cool completely.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 
            cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl until 
            smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in vanilla extract 
            and salt. Reduce speed to low and gradually mix 
            in powdered sugar. Increase speed to high and 
            beat frosting until light and fluffy, about 2 
            minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>

            and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Place 1 cake, domed side down, on a platter. 
            Spread ¾ cup frosting evenly over top. 
            Place remaining cake, domed side down, on 
            top. Spread top and sides with 1¼ cups 
            frosting and chill 30 minutes to let 
            frosting set. Spread remaining frosting 
            over top and sides, swirling decoratively. 
            Top with Candied Carrot Coins, if desired.
