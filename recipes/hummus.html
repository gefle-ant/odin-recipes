    <h2>The Hummus, among us.</h2>
        <p>
            Hummus isn't just a great snack, it's also a lifestyle. 
            Seriously, ask anyone in Tel-Aviv if they've gone more 
            than 24 hours without consuming some. There isn't much 
            that doesn't go with hummus, it's endlessly customizable,
            like linux and whether you want to go super or creamy
            or rustic, skin on, canned beans, and 5 mins in a blender
            you'll probably end up pleasing anyone around you. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
            You'll want to think about customization before you make
            the effort. Roasted peppers or garlic, virgin olive oil,
            toased bread seasoned bread sticks, the sky's the limit. 
            Having a food processor, or a gas powered blender would 
            be recomended though I'm sure a person would be alright 
            a spoon, a mashing device of some sort and some muscles.
            Happy hummusing!

    <h3>Humble Hummus - Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a bowl, cover chickpeas by at least 
            2 inches of cold water. Add 1 teaspoon 
            baking soda and let soak at room 
            temperature overnight. Drain and rinse.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium pot, cover soaked chickpeas 
            by at least 4 inches of water. Add the 
            remaining teaspoon baking soda and 
            bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce 
            heat to medium high and let cook at a 
            vigorous simmer until chickpeas are 
            quite soft, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. 
            (Overcooked chickpeas are the secret 
            to creamy hummus, so don’t worry if 
            they start to break down a little.) 
            Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            While chickpeas are cooking, make the 
            tahini sauce. In a blender, combine 
            the lemon juice, garlic and 1/4 
            teaspoon salt. Let mixture sit 10 
            minutes. Add tahini, remaining 1 1/2 
            teaspoons salt and the cumin, and 
            blend until a thick paste forms. Add 
            1/3 to 2/3 cup ice water while blender 
            is running, a little at a time, until 
            sauce is smooth. You’re looking for a 
            perfectly smooth, creamy sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the warm, drained chickpeas to 
            blender with tahini mixture. Blend 
            until perfectly smooth and not at 
            all grainy, stopping to scrape down 
            sides of bowl occasionally. This 
            blending may take upward of about 
            2 minutes; just keep going until 
            the mixture is ultracreamy and fluffy, 
            adding a little water if you need 
            it to make the contents of the 
            blender move. Taste for seasonings, 
            adding more salt, lemon juice 
            and/or cumin as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, spread the hummus on 
            a plate, dust with paprika, drizzle 
            with olive oil and sprinkle with 
            parsley. 
        </li>
    </ol>
