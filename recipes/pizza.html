    <h2>Chi-Pie - Grandma-Style Pepperoni-no-Baloney
        Pizza</h2>
        <p> Chi-Pie is whatever you want it to be. 
            Many people associate the Chicago pizza 
            scene with deepdish or pie looking pizzas,
            hence the name <em>chi-pie</em>. My personal
            prefference is the grandma style pizza
            that might be more associated with Detroit
            or Brooklyn. Don't be fooled it has a 
            serious following in the Chicagoland 
            pizza scene.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a simple pan-style recipe that
            results in a crispy, cheese, almost fried
            foccacia dough. For best results, keep the
            ingredients to a minimum, use a dry mozzerella
            and do your best to make sure the dough has
            risen sufficiently.

            <li>
                Stir together yeast and 1¾ cups warm water 
                (40-42°) in the bowl of a stand mixer; let 
                stand until yeast starts to foam, about 10 minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Mix in 2 Tbsp. oil, then salt and 2 cups flour.
                Attach dough hook and mix until just combined. 
                Scrape down sides of bowl. Add another 2 cups 
                flour, a cup at a time, mixing until incorporated
                and a shaggy dough forms, about 3 minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Increase speed to medium and mix until dough is
                soft and elastic and starts to pull away from 
                sides of bowl, 5-6 minutes. It will still be 
                somewhat sticky. Place dough in a lightly oiled 
                bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Chill 24 hours.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Coat an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet with remaining 
                ½ cup oil. Turn out dough onto a rimmed baking 
                sheet and let sit 10 minutes to take off the chill. 
                Gently and gradually stretch dough until it reaches 
                edges and all 4 corners of baking sheet. (If dough 
                springs back or is stiff to work with, let it rest 
                a few minutes before continuing. You may need to 
                let it rest more than once.) 
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Cover dough on baking sheet tightly with plastic 
                wrap and let sit in a warm place (but not too 
                warm!—about 70° is ideal for yeast to grow) 
                until it is puffed and full of air bubbles, 30-40 
                minutes.

    <h3>Chi-Pie Grandma-Style, Pepperoni-no-Baloney<br>
        Pizza Ingredients.
    </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Choose a pizza sauce of your liking, I often
                use a napoli or arrbiata style pasta sausce
                1-2 cups should be enough depending how saucy
                you like it.
            </li>
            <li>
                100-200 grams of pepperoni sausage, or spicy
                salami. Chorrizo is also nice.
            </li>
            <li>
                300-400 grams of dry mozzerella or a well drained
                wet mozzerella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                100 grams of parmigiano reggiano or other quality<br>
                parmigian cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                2 Tbsp dried oregano
            </li>
            <li>
                salt and pepper for garnish, a couple grinds or 
                pinches will do over the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enough olive oil to coat the bottom of your pizza pan.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Chi-Pie PAP &#40Pizza Action Plan&#41</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Before you begin, turn your heat loving oven
                up to 200° (celcius is or bust) and let it
                get good and hot, with the fan on if you have one
                for 45-50 min.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Flatten your room temperature dough into a <em>well</em>
                oiled aluminum or steel baking pan. The pan
                have be at least 4-5cm deep. If the dough doesn't
                want to strech out or if it's still a little cold,
                rest it in pan for 5 min and go at it again until
                the dough is all the way to the edges of the pan
                and even up the sides a bit.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                With your dough in place, sausce it to your desired
                level of sauciness, which will thicken as the pizza
                cooks. <strong>Use care!</strong>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Spread your mozzerella and Parmigiana all over the 
                place, cover that pizza to the edges. Do it! save 
                a little sprinkle of both to put on some off your
                pepperoni.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Give the cheeses a grind of pepper, salt, and a
                sprinkle or oregano. Bring the flavor!
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Now do the same with the pepperoni, cover the surface,
                so you can just make out what is below. Don be shy!
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the remaining cheeses in a random a fashion
                over the top of the pepperoni, just a little is needed
                or skip it all together. We want that pepperoni goodness
                to get crispy.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Toss that magnificent pizza into the oven, and keep
                an eye on it for 25-35 min. When the pepperoni's 
                look good and crispy but not too browned, it is time
                to bring it out, let it cool for 10 min. You will
                want to run a spatula around the edges to help release
                the pizza.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Either cut the pizza in the pan with a pizza cutter, or
                if possible, remove it an sever it on a wooden cutting 
                board or something similiar. Enjoy!
